## Inspiration
In major metropolitan areas throughout the United States, there has become a huge challenge of unhoused individuals and communities with unstable living conditions. For example Los Angeles has experienced a 4% increase in its homeless population during the pandemic, with 69,144 unhoused people counted across the county this year.

## What it does
We utilize cutting edge technologies like VR, Mixed Reality and Machine Learning to help the unhoused conceptualize, customize and co-create their dream home.

## How we built it
**Leia:**
->We built the Leia Part using Figma to display interactions on the Leia tablet,
then we converted 3D models to 3D view to be compatible with the Leia viewer.

**SnapdragonSpaces:**
-> in SnapdragonSpaces we showcase the housing options in MR, 
we utilized the plane detection feature on SnapdragonSpaces to place the Esri extracted map
on the ground on MR upon the users click , the map has small scale houses representing housing options on the desired areas, when the user clicks on of them the map will disappear and the housing option selected will scale up to real life scale house where the user can move around freely on MR,
also have the option to go back to the map and select another housing option.

## Challenges we ran into
- Technical Challenges:
-> The lack of documentation & support of some 3D visualization features on Leia .
-> Visualization on a headset with Narrow FOV (SnapdragonSpaces limitations).
-> low See through Quality when it comes to rendering models (SnapdragonSpaces).
-> No spectator view of what's actually happening inside the headset (SnapdragonSpaces).
-> Sudden software updates that resulted in an unexpected behaviours (SnapdragonSpaces).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to come together as a newly formed team and succeed to build something that wasn't created 3 days ago. We were able to take an ambitious goal of creating housing for the unhoused and honed in on a strong road map to approach the challenge.

## What we learned
New hardware, new devices, new pipelines. We learned about people's interest in the unhoused and there's a desire to see something happen for the better. That together, we can achieve a tremendous amount of progress. WE

## What's next for Stone Soup
We look forward to continuing our project. We spoke to a few mentors and they are excited to assist in opening their resources in grant writing, partner alliance, and gaining more research for the community. We look forward to building out a business plan and identifying our first partner to implement our solution.
